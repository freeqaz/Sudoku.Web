Sudoku.Web
==========

A sudoku app that's touch friendly. It's designed so that you select a square and then the valid moves pop up, so it's easy to play on your phone. (A lot of other approaches use <input> which requires popping up the keyboard)

This is built without using any constraining frameworks that make assumptions for you. Simple JQuery plugin with some basic click functionality. :D

Install Instructions
===============

1. Install node.js and npm (just google it)
2. Install bower: `npm install -g bower`
3. Clone repo and open shell in directory
  * `npm install`
  * `bower install`
4. Build app by invoking gulp: `gulp`
5. Run web server (simple node file server): `node server.js`
6. Connect to `localhost:8080`
7. Get some iced tea and chill out, because sudoku is hard!
